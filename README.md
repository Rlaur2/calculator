# calculator
Create a calculator with all the basic functions

Bugs to fix and things to do
1. Hitting an operator multiple times yields unexpected results, many bugs to count here - Fixed the major bugs! Finding new bugs will require more testing.

2. Clicking on 'equal' before having two operands also yields unexpected results. - Fixed the major bugs! Finding new bugs will require more testing.

3. Dividing by zero returns a string, clear out the string from the array when this happens - Fixed

3. Add functionality to 'clear', '.', and 'BACK' buttons - All added

4. Add functionality to mini-display up top - done

5. Make whole thing look a little nicer at the end, like hover buttons and animations when a button gets clicked - Done, more can be added however at a later time

6. Add limit to number size when received as answer, also fix the decimal point to the hundredth, maybe thousandth, place when received as answer - Done

7. Add keyboard support

8. There is no functionality to create negative numbers. Might add this in the future but not atm.
