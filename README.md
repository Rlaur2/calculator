# calculator
Create a calculator with all the basic functions

I've completed the calculator project. Fixing all of the bugs with clicking an operator multiple times and making sure it functions properly was easily the hardest part about this project. I was able to complete the whole thing without looking anything up other than the key names for the keyboard buttons which seems to be extremely straight forward.

- Future additions
If I ever revisit this project there are a few things I'll add. 

A button to change the current operand to it's negative version and vice-versa. 

Probably completely re-do the CSS, I need to learn shadows and animations in order for my projects to not be mistaken for MS Paint images.
