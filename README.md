# calculator
Create a calculator with all the basic functions

Bugs to fix and things to do
1. Hitting an operator multiple times yields unexpected results, many bugs to count here

2. Clicking on 'equal' before having two operands also yields unexpected results.

3. Dividing by zero returns a string, clear out the string from the array when this happens

3. Add functionality to 'clear', '.', and 'BACK' buttons

4. Add functionality to mini-display up top

5. Make whole thing look a little nicer at the end
