# calculator
Create a calculator with all the basic functions

Bugs to fix and things to do
1. Hitting an operator multiple times yields unexpected results, many bugs to count here - Fixed the major bugs!

2. Clicking on 'equal' before having two operands also yields unexpected results. - Mostly fixed, gotta do some more testing

3. Dividing by zero returns a string, clear out the string from the array when this happens

3. Add functionality to 'clear', '.', and 'BACK' buttons - clear functionality added

4. Add functionality to mini-display up top

5. Make whole thing look a little nicer at the end, like hover buttons

6. Add limit to number size when received as answer, also fix the decimal point to the hundredth, maybe thousandth, place when received as answer

7. Add keyboard support
